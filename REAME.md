# Instructions for reproducing bugs

1. Go to the dropdown list marked with "START HERE!"
2. Select one of the six bugs from the dropdown list

The shader source code of the corresponding bug will then be loaded
into the textarea marked with placeholder "Source of fragment shader."

The browser on your local machine will compile and execute the shader and display the rendering
output image on the left. The expected image of the corresponding bug is
displayed on the right.

If you have one of our tested GPUs: Intel 12400, AMD Radeon 6400,
or NVIDIA RTX 3600, and the webpage is opened in Chrome on a Windows
system, you would see that the rendered image is different from the expected image.
